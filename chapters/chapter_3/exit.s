# PURPOSE:  Simple program that exits and returns a
#          status code back to the Linux kernel
#
# INPUT:    none
#
# OUTPUT:   returns a status code.  This can be viewed
# by typing #
# echo $?
#          after running the program
#
# VARIABLES:
#          %eax holds the system call number
#          %ebx holds the return status
#

.section .data

 .globl _start

_start:
 movl $1, %eax
 movl $0, %ebx
 int $0x80

# this is the linux kernel command
# number (system call) for exiting
# a program
# this is the status number we will
# return to the operating system.
# Change this around and it will
# return different things to
# echo $?
# this wakes up the kernel to run
# the exit command
